# VAGVAL's REPO for KODI

This is my personal repo, free to use for all, and contains some mirrored addons which is EOL, and some updated by me like Seren for Python 2 Kodi's , <19.0 Kodi

## Feautures - Contents of repo

After a lot of trial and error this repo is refactored to fetch different version of addons based on <19.0 or >=19 Kodi Version.
The Repository is only having a Python 3 version, so is pointless the host of older versions of addons that worked on <19.0 but it can be installed manually.

An update to Repository zip is coming to support also the install of repo in kodi <19.0

Also every time the repository has an update it pushes it as "repository.vagval.zip" in the homeppage of this repository to always download the latest zip file, for someone to add it first time via url.

TODO: Update the Repository to support the <19.0 kodi.
