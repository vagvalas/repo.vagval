# VAGVAL's REPO for KODI

This is my personal repo, free to use for all, and contains some mirrored addons which is EOL, and some updated by me like Seren for Python 2 Kodi's , <19.0 Kodi

## Feautures - Contents of repo

After a lot of trial and error this repo is refactored to fetch different version of addons based on <19.0 or >=19 Kodi Version.


Also every time the repository has an update it pushes it as "repository.vagval.zip" in the homeppage of this repository to always download the latest zip file, for someone to add it first time via url.

~~TODO: Update the Repository to support the <19.0 kodi.~~
TODO: Add a fanart and an icon pack for repo. blah...
